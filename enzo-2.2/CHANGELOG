_Release date - Oct 27, 2011_

  * Enhancement: Test suite is now fully operational.  See run/README for more details.
  * Enhancement: The “must refine” region can move with a user-defined, time-dependent refine region (parameter RefineRegionFile and refinement option 12)
  * Bugfix: Enzo now compiles with HDF5 v1.6.x (Michael Kuhlen)
  * Bugfix: User-defined time-dependent refine region now works with code time (David Collins)
  * Bugfix: Photon timesteps no longer go to tiny numbers (~1e-20) in certain situations when using the HII-restricted timestepping algortihm.
