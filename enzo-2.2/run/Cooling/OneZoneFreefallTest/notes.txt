OneZoneFreefallTest
----------------

This test problem will set up a 2D grid varying in energy and metallicity.  
All points have the same density, which evolves according to the analytical 
solution for free-fall collapse.  The timestep is calculated as a fraction of 
the free-fall time.  Since the timestep continually decreases, outputs are 
done on cycles.  This test problem can be used to test chemistry and 
cooling routines.

The script, plot.py, will create plots of n vs. T (and Tdust), n
vs. f_H2, and n vs. t_cool/t_dyn.  If using H2 formation on 
dust grains, set dust=True on line 10.  Run this script like this:

python plot.py OneZoneFreefallTest.enzo
