From
 Brio, M., & Wu, C. C. 1988, J. Comput. Phys., 75, 400
 Wang, P., & Abel, T. 2009, Astrophysical Journal, 696:96-109

Run: Ji-hoon Kim, July 2010


Test Description
================

This test sets up an one-dimensional Riemann problem for MHD, and has become a useful 
standard test for any MHD solver.  Detailed description of the initial set up can be 
found in the papers above.  This test problem is new for enzo2.0.  It uses the new 
Stanford hydro_rk solver.

This test runs to completion while generating 12 outputs, and scripts.py will 
produce the plots for Density, x-velocity, By, Internal Energy for the last snapshot 
(t=0.1).  This last snapshot should be compared to figure 18 from Figure 2 of Brio & 
Wu (1988) or Figure 15 of Wang & Abel (2009)

Success in test_briowu.py is determined by nearly exact match (5e-3) in Density and By.
