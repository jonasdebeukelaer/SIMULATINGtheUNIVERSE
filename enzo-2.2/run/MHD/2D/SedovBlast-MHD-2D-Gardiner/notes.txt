Test Description
================

This test sets up a two-dimensional blast wave problem for MHD, and has become a useful 
standard test for any MHD solver.  While the initial condition  essentially describes 
a circular overpressurized region in a low-pressure magnetized medium, more detailed 
description of the initial set up can be found in the papers above.  This test problem 
is new for enzo2.0.  It uses the new Stanford hydro_rk solver.  

Unfortunately for some users, most of the key parameters are hard-coded in 
Grid_MHD2DTestInitializeGrid.C.  With zero B-field, this test should be a pure Sedov 
blast wave problem.    

This test runs to completion while generating 12 outputs, and scripts.py will 
produce the plots for Density, x-velocity, By, Internal Energy for the last snapshot 
(t=0.02).  This last snapshot should be compared to Figure 13 of Gardiner & Stone (2005)
or Figure 16 of Wang & Abel (2009)

Success in test_gardiner.py is determined by nearly exact match (3e-5) in Density, 
Pressure, Bx, and By.
