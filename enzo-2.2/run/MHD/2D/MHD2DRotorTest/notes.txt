Test Description
================

A cylander of gas is set rotating in a uniform medium, with uniform magnetic
field perpandicular to the rotation axis.  A torsional Alfven wave is launched
from the surface, and propogates to the simulation boundary at the end of the
simulation.

This test is useful as it can and will cause negative densities for some
solvers; it also demonstrates physics unique to the MHD system, providing a
useful comparison.

Visual comparison to the plots in Toth (2000) shows that the general morphology
and extent of the Alfven wave is similar.  Round contours in the mach number
field indicate solid body rotation, without the artifacts seen in some other
solvers.  

Success in test_rotor.py is determined by nearly exact match (1e-12) in L1 norm between
Density, Bx, P, and Mach number. 

This test generates 11 outputs, and snapshots for the 4 above fields for each
snapshot.  The 11th snapshot should be compared to figure 18 from Toth (2000)
