SedovBlast-MHD-2D-Fryxell
=========================
From
 Fryxell et al, 2000, ApJS, 131, 273 (Section 7.4)

Test Description
================

This test sets up a two-dimensional blast wave problem for MHD.  While the initial 
condition  essentially describes a circular overpressurized region in a low-pressure 
magnetized medium, more detailed description of the initial set up can be found in 
the papers above.  This test problem is new for enzo2.0.  It uses the new Stanford 
hydro_rk solver.  

Unfortunately for some users, some of the key parameters are hard-coded in 
Grid_MHD2DTestInitializeGrid.C.  Depending on B-field values, this test can be a 
pure Sedov blast wave problem, or a Gardiner blast wave problem.  The current 
parameter will give Sedov blast wave solution. 

(1) Setting LowerBx=LowerBy=0 will give the traditional Sedov test 
    with no B-field, essentially very similar to SedovBlast-AMR.enzo; 
    but with different hydro solver (Stanford HD/MHD)
(2) Setting LowerBx=LowerBy=5 will give the Sedov blast with the 
    presence of B-field, very similar to SedovBlast-MHD-2D-Gardiner.enzo;
    but the exact setup is somewhat different (see the code)

This test runs to completion while generating 12 outputs, and scripts.py will 
produce the plots and slices for Density and Pressure of the last snapshot (t=0.05).  
This last snapshot should be compared to Figure 29 and 30 of Fryxell (2000).

Success in test_fryxell.py is determined by nearly exact match (3e-5) in Density and 
Pressure.
