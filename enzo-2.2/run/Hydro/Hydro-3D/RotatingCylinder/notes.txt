The rotating cylinder is a test of the conservation of the
angular momentum in Enzo.

The test sets up a rotating gas cyclinder in the center of the box at 0.5 0.5
0.5 with an overdensity of 200. The default set up is with a root grid
of 32^3 and a single level of refinement. 

The cyclinder collapses towards its center and oscillates before
settling. 

The results signify correctness if the net change in the total angular
momentum of the system is low (< 5%). The percentage change per output
should be less than 1% and should decrease over time as the collapse
 reaches equilibrium. 

In plots.py, we image slices in the x-direction and plot the angular
momentum evolution of the system.
