The Noh Problem test sets up a a uniform gas of density of 1.0 that
has a uniform inward radial velocity of 1.0

Noh (1987) J. Comp. Phys. 72, 78 introduced an infinite shock
reflection problem that has an exact analytical solution. Gas with
initially uniform density of 1 and zero pressure converges onto the
origin with a uniform radial velocity of 1 in a unit domain x, y \in
[0, 1].

In spherical geometry (3D) the postshock density is 64 and in the
preshock region the density varies as (1 + t/sqrt(x^2 + y^2))^2. All
other dependencies remain the same as in the 2D case.

We set the initial pressure to be 10^-6 instead of zero for numerical
reasons. We use reflecting boundaries at x=0 and at y=0 and set up the
outer boundaries at x=1 and y=1 based on the exact analytical
solution.  We follow the propagation of the shock until it reaches a
radius of 2/3 at t=2. At this point we compare our results with
similar tests performed with other Eulerian numerical schemes, see
Liska & Wendroff (2003), Section 4.5 in this PDF document or in SIAM
J. Sci. Comput. 25, 995, 2003. See also Rider (2000),
J. Comp. Phys. 162, 395 for a discussion of "wall heating" phenomenon
near the origin that seriously affects the results obtained with
Lagrangian schemes. Numerically, this is a difficult problem.

Results
------

Enzo-1.5 : This test problem runs to completion.  We check the
accuracy by producing a scatter plot of the density as a function of
radius for all the zones in the simulation as well as only the zones
along the x=y=z diagonal, and compare them to the analytical result.
The location of the shock as well as the pre-shock behavior is very
accurate.  The diagonal zones match up very well near the shock but
fall below the analytical value of 64 towards the center.  A scatter
plot of all the zones shows there is larger variation on the
off-diagonal zones.  By examining a slice of the density in the z=0
plane, we see that edge effects seem to be playing a role in the
variation in the post-shock region, artificially raising the density.

Note that Enzo-1.5 requires:
RightFaceBoundaryCondition  = 4 4 4 //  undefined
and Enzo-2.0 requires
RightFaceBoundaryCondition  = 6 6 6 //  undefined

Enzo-2.0 : This test problem currently fails the Enzo-2.0 revision
mentioned above with an euler: dnu <= 0.

Testing
------

To run the analysis script to compare to the analytical result, run:

python scripts.py

This produces two plots for each dataset:
noh3damr_####_Slice_z_Density.png - A slice of the density
noh3damr_####_density.png - A radial profile of density and comparison to the
analytical result

Regression Testing
---------------
There are three tests:
noh3damr_image: Tests a fixed resolution image (400x400) of Density to delta's of 5.0e-3
noh3damr_max: Tests the maximum density value with a delta of 5.0e-3
noh3damr_radial: Tests density radial profile with the shape to exact accuracy and delta to 5.0e-3
