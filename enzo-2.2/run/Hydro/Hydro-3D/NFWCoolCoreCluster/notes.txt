The NFW Cool-Core Cluster is a simulation of the cooling flow in an idealized
cool-core cluster that resembles Perseus cluster. It can be a test for cooling, and
maybe gravity too. 

The default set up is with a root grid of 64^3, a maximum refinement level of 12,
and MinimumMassForRefinementLevelExponent of -0.2 (for better resolution, use -1.2)
which can be changed based on the resolution one needs.

The default set up has a static gravity and no self-gravity of the gas since the latter
is much smaller than the gravity of the dark matter and does not change much during the 
early stage of the cooling flow evolution.

As the cooling catastrophe happens, the temperature drops to the bottom of the cooling 
function ~ 10^4 K in the center within ~1kpc with the default resolution. The size of 
the region becomes smaller with higher resolution.

The projected gas density shows a disk of size ~ 1kpc (inside the cooling catastrophe
region) at late times along z axis which is the direction of 
the initial angular momentum of the gas.
