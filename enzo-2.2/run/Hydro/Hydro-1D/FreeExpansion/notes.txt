(John Wise, July 2010)

This test simulates a blastwave in the free expansion phase.  In the
initial setup, the interior region has a uniform density and a
linearly increasing radial velocity.  The blastwave should advect
outwards, and create a high entropy shell and have little oscillations
in the shock.  

This test runs to completion and creates 41 outputs.  This test
problem is new for version 2.0.  It uses the new hydro_rk solver.

The initial setup is taken from Truelove & McKee, 1999, ApJS, 120,
299.
