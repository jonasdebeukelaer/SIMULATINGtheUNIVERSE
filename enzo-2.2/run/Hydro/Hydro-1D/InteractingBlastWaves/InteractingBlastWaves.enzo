# PROBLEM DEFINITION FILE: 
#
#  Two interacting blast waves
#
#  This is the first test problem in Woodward & Colella (1984), 
#  JCP, 54, 115.  With the outer tenths of the domain 
#  overpressurized, two blast waves move in toward the center.  The
#  boundaries are reflecting.  One can see the solution by ATHENA in 
#  Stone et al. (2008), ApJS, 178, 137.
