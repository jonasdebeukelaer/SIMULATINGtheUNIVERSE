The Noh Problem test sets up a a uniform gas of density of 1.0 that
has a uniform inward radial velocity of 1.0

Noh (1987) J. Comp. Phys. 72, 78 introduced an infinite shock
reflection problem that has an exact analytical solution. Gas with
initially uniform density of 1 and zero pressure converges onto the
origin with a uniform radial velocity of 1 in a unit domain x, y \in
[0, 1].

In cylindrical geometry (2D) the solution is an infinite strength
circularly symmetric shock reflecting from the origin. In the
postshock region the density is 16, the velocity is zero, and the
pressure is 16/3. The shock speed is 1/3, and in the preshock region
the density varies as a function of time and radius as (1 + t/sqrt(x^2
+ y^2)) while velocity and pressure keep their initial values.

We set the initial pressure to be 10^-6 instead of zero for numerical
reasons. We use reflecting boundaries at x=0 and at y=0 and set up the
outer boundaries at x=1 and y=1 based on the exact analytical
solution.  We follow the propagation of the shock until it reaches a
radius of 2/3 at t=2. At this point we compare our results with
similar tests performed with other Eulerian numerical schemes, see
Liska & Wendroff (2003), Section 4.5 in this PDF document or in SIAM
J. Sci. Comput. 25, 995, 2003. See also Rider (2000),
J. Comp. Phys. 162, 395 for a discussion of "wall heating" phenomenon
near the origin that seriously affects the results obtained with
Lagrangian schemes. Numerically, this is a difficult problem.

Results
------

Enzo-1.5 : This test problem runs to completion.  We check the
accuracy by producing a scatter plot of the density as a function of
radius for all the zones in the simulation as well as only the zones
along the x=y=z diagonal, and compare them to the analytical result.
The location of the shock as well as the pre-shock behavior is very
accurate for all zones.  The diagonal zones match up very well in the
postshock-region with the analytical result.  A scatter plot of all
the zones shows small amounts of scatter around the analytical
result. The zones along the x=0 and y=0 boundaries are artificially
higher than the analytical result.  This seems to be a systematic
result, so there may be an issue here.

Enzo-2.0 : This test problem runs to completion.  It improves upon the
results from Enzo-1.5, getting rid of the boundary effects.  Now other
than the post-shock oscillations, the result is very accurate with
respect to the analytical result, with acceptable errors.

Testing
------

To run the analysis script to compare to the analytical result, run:

python scripts.py

This produces two plots for each dataset:
noh2d_####_Slice_z_Density.png - A slice of the density
noh2d_####_density.png - A radial profile of density and comparison to the
analytical result

Regression Testing
---------------
There are three tests:
noh2damr_image: Tests a fixed resolution image (400x400) of Density to delta's of 5.0e-3
noh2damr_max: Tests the maximum density value with a delta of 5.0e-3
noh2damr_radial: Tests density radial profile with the shape (subject to AMR differences) to exact accuracy and delta to 5.0e-3

$ ./enzo-1.5 -d NohProblem2D.enzo
$ enzo_test store enzo-1.5 test_noh2d.py
$ rm -rf DD* OutputLog
$ ./enzo-2.0 -d NohProblem2D.enzo
$ enzo_test compare enzo-1.5 enzo-2.0 $ test_noh2d.py

Note that regression between enzo-1.5 and enzo-2.0 fails for all t >
0.  However, enzo-2.0 is the preferred result.
