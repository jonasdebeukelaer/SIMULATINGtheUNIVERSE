(John Wise, July 2010)

This test simulates a blastwave in the free expansion phase.  In the
initial setup, the interior region has a uniform density and a
linearly increasing radial velocity.  The blastwave should advect
outwards, and create a high entropy shell and have little oscillations
in the shock.  It is exactly the same as the FreeExpansion 1D test,
but in two dimensions and with 2 levels of AMR.  There is usually some
non-spherical in the reverse shock, but the main outer shock should
always be nearly spherical.  The artifacts in the reverse shock
originate from the initial discretization and decreases if the
resolution is increased.

This test runs to completion and creates 21 outputs.  This test
problem is new for version 2.0.  It uses the new hydro_rk solver.

The initial setup is taken from Truelove & McKee, 1999, ApJS, 120,
299.
