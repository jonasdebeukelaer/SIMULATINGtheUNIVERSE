AMRShockPool2D
--------------

The Shock Pool test sets up a system which introduces a shock from the left
boundary. The initial active region is uniform, and the shock wave enters via
inflow boundary conditions. (D. Mihalas & B.W.
Mihalas, Foundations of Radiation Hydrodynamics, 1984, p. 236, eq. 56-40.)

This is a calculation of an oblique shock, at a 45 degree angle, moving from
one corner to the opposite corner.  The parameter file, as written, allows for
the shock to reach the opposite corner and should output ~42 outputs.

These results signify correctness if the shock hits the opposite corner at
approximately 0.55.  When this happens, the density contrast throughout the
domain will be greatly reduced, and large fans should be visible on the top and
bottom.

Before the shock hits the wall, the unshocked gas should be of density exactly
1.0, and the shocked gas should be of density ~2.7.  At roughly 10*dx up and
downstream, these values should be correct within a percent.  In plot.py, we
calculate the shock location and overplot that on top of a "ray" plot from
corner-to-corner.
