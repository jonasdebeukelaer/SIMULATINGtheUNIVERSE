# PROBLEM DEFINITION FILE: Double Mach Reflection test (see WC84, Section IVc)
#
# Mach = 10 shock in air at 60 degrees angle with respect to a reflecting wall.
# The gas density ahead of the shock is 1.4, and the pressure is 1.0; density
# behind the shock is 8.0.
#
# Compare with WC84 Figure 4 at t = 2.0. Note, the diffusion is OFF here;
# also note the figure shows only a part of the domain: 0 < x < 3.
#
# Most of the required parameters were hardwired, see DoubleMachInitialize.C.
