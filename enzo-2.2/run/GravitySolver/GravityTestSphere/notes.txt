GravityTest
----------

(Greg Bryan, July 2010)

This test places a sphere with radius 0.01 and a very
large overdensity in an AMR box with size 1.0 and
computes the resulting velocity change due to gravity.
It is similar to TestGravity but uses a sphere and
baryons instead of a single particle.  No analytic
solution is computed.  More work on this test should
be done to compare to an analytic solution.
