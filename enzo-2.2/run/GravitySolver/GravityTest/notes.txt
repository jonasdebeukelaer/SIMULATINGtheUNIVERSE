GravityTest
----------

(Greg Bryan, July 2010)

This test places a single, massive particle at the center of the box
and then places 5000 nearly massless particles throughout the rest
of the box, randomly spaced in log radius from the center, and
randomly placed in angle.  A single small step is taken, and the
velocity is then divided by the timestep to measure the acceleration.
A single subgrid is placed in the center from 0.4375 to 0.5625
(in units where the box size is 1.0). 

This tests the acceleration of the particles from a single point
mass and so can be directed compared to the r^-2 expected
result.  An output file is generated, called TestGravityCheckResults.out,
which contains four columns with one entry for each of the
5000 particles.  The columns are the radius (in units of the
cell length of the most refined grid), the tangential component
of the measured force, as computed by the code, 
the radial component of the computed force, and finally
the "true" (unsoftened) force.  

The tangential component of the force should be zero; the
radial component should follow the r^-2 law, but is softened
for radii less than about one cell length (or slightly larger).
It also falls below r^-2 are large distances because this
problem uses periodic boundary conditions (The code has
been modified since this problem was originally written
to use isolated boundary conditions, but this problem
has not been changed).

The test for this problem is to compute the rms force
error between 1 and 8 cell distances from the center.
For CIC, this is measured to be about 5%.  The test
checks to make sure this has not changed by more than 1%.
This is not an ideal check, as many errors could
conceivably escape undetected (e.g. those having to do
with force errors at small and large radii); however, the problem
with a bitwise comparison is that the positions of
the 5000 particles are random (with no setable seed).
