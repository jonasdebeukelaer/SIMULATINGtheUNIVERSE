TestOrbit
---------

(Greg Bryan, July 2010)

This test places two particles in an otherwise empty box, one at the
center (0.5 0.5 0.5) with mass 1.0, and a second at position 0.2 0.5
0.5 with mass 1.0e-6.  The initial velocity is set such that the
second particle is in a circular orbit around the first.  The system
is evolved for 2.0 time units without AMR but with isolated gravity
boundary conditions.  This makes it complete a bit over 1 orbit.
The test is to check the final particle positions.

For the test to run with enzo 1.5 compile with:
  make isolated-bcs-yes
  make unigrid-transpose-no
