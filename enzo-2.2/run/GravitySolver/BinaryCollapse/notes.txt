(Stephen Skory, June 2010)

This test runs to completion. There are 8 data dumps, DD0000 to DD0007.
This test does not work in 1.5 because problem 202 is not defined there.

I ran my tests with opt-debug using the intel/openmpi stack on Triton on 3 June 2010.

2.0 test:

Running with the 2.0 enzo produces a binary collapse of
matter that begins to form two dense clumps best viewed along the z-axis.
The yt plotting script included will plot this nicely, zoomed in on the inner
third of the volume.

I have made some changes to this file from how it was previously.
I removed the magnetic field, and I changed the stop time so this test takes
roughly 1 hour on 8 cores. As it was written before, it would have taken many
hours to reach completion, and I am fundamentally against test problems that
take more than 1 hour.
