Turner & Stone Equilibration Tests
[Matter-radiation equilibration in a homogeneous medium]


In this problem, both e and E are spatially uniform but are
initialized to values far away from equilibrium.  This case thus
exercises the matter-radiation coupling terms in our gas and 
radiation energy equations for our model that assumes local
thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e. no chemistry).  

We assume an isotropic medium characterized by a single opacity of
4e-8 cm^{-1}, a gas density of 1e-7 g cm^{-3}, and an average particle
mass of 0.6 m_h, where m_h is the mass of a hydrogen atom.  Coupled to
this medium is a radiation field with a uniform value of 1e12 erg
cm^{-3}.  This radiation field therefore corresponds to a ``radiation
temperature'', T_r = (E/a_r)^{1/4}, of about 3.4e6 K.  Here we have
defined a_r as the radiation constant, 7.56e-15 erg cm^{-3} K^{-1}.

Two cases are considered: one in which the initial gas energy density
is e = 1e10 erg cm^{-3}, and the other with e = 1e2 erg cm^{-3}.
These parameters correspond to gas temperatures of roughly 4.8e8 and
4.8 K, respectively, which therefore bracket the radiation
temperature.  In both cases, however, the initial radiation
temperature is sufficiently high that the radiation energy density
should remain constant to good approximation as the gas evolves to
thermal equilibrium.  

These tests are run in a small box domain (4^3 zones) with
triply-periodic boundaries. The case of T(0) < T_r is performed in the
files TurnerStoneEquil1, and the T(0) > T_r case is performed in the
files TurnerStoneEquil2.

Analysis may be performed using the ts_makeplots.py script, assuming
that you have the python packages matplotlib and scipy installed.

Alternatively, the final equilibrium values of these two simulations
should be approximately:

   test    | e (internal) |  e (CGS)  | E (internal) |   E (CGS)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
   1: c->h |   6.9968     | 6.9968e14 |   9.9993     | 9.9993e+11
   2: h->c |   7.0144     | 7.0144e14 |   1.0099     | 1.0099e+11
