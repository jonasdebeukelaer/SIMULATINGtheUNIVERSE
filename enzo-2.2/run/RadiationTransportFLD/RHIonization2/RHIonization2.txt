Iliev et al. Ionization Test 2
[Radiative ionization in a static medium]


In this problem we couple E, e and nHI together in a
hydrodynamically-static environment.  The physical situation of 
interest is the expansion of an ionized hydrogen (HII) region in a
uniform gas around a single ionizing source emitting 5e48 photons per
second, along a T=1e5 black-body spectrum.  In such a problem, the
radiation source should rapidly ionize the surrounding hydrogen, and
then should develop a spherically-propagating ionization front
(I-front) that propages quickly at first, slows, and then eventually
stagnates.

We have the following problem parameters: 
- the domain size is L=6.6 kpc in each direction,
- the initial gas number density is nH = 1e-3 cm^{-3},
- the initial radiation energy density is E = 1e-20 erg cm^{-3},
- the initial gas temperature is T = 1e2 K
- the initial ionization fraction (HII/H) is 
- the ionization source is located in the lower corner of the box (the
  (1,1,1) cell),
- we use reflecting boundary conditions at the x-, y- and z-left
  boundaries, and outflow conditions at the corresponding right
  boundaries.  
- the total simulation time is 500 Myr.

For this scenario, we have no simple analytical solution to compare
our computed solutions against.  Instead, the analysis script
iliev2_makeplots.py, plots a number of quantities from the computed
solution.  From previous tests, the solution should have the following
behavior: 
- [rad_vs_time.pdf] The I-front radius should cross the Stromgren
  radius at t = 1.5 t_{rec}, and by t = 4.0 t_{rec} r_I should be
  around 1.1 r_S. 
- [profiles_*Myr.pdf] The r/L_{box} where the HI and HII fractions
  should be at these times is about (10 Myr, 0.35 L), 
  (100 Myr, 0.7 L), and (500 Myr, 0.95 L)
- [Econtour_*Myr.pdf, TempContour_*Myr.pdf, HIContour_*Myr.pdf] These
  2D contour plots through z=0 should show spherically-symmetric
  propagation of the I-front (down to grid resolution).
