== Notes on the output ==

(Geoffrey So May 21, 2010)

This is a small cosmology test which requires ~16GB of disk 
space and the last data output slice should be DD0273


== General Information ==
(Please refer to the parameter files for more detailed description)

-machine name: SDSC Triton
-core count: 8
-Grid: 64 cube
-LambdaCDM cosmology
-Final Redshift z = 5
-Radiation Solver = Daniel Reynolds' operator split FLD solver
-Star maker method 1, feedback method 0

The output should create non-zero values in Geoffrey's Emissivity field once star 
formation occurs, and this will source the Grey_Radiation_Energy field.  The values of the 
output will depend on many factors, including but not exclusive to machine hardware (which 
affects the way initial conditions are generated), compilers used to compile Enzo, whether the 
simulation was restarted in the middle, precision of the data output, and different versions 
of software i.e. hypre.  Keep in mind that these differences will be small, and should not
cause answers to change by orders of magnitude.


= Running =
1. First run inits.exe (from src/inits) on the file
   CosmologyFLD_RT.inits:
      inits.exe CosmologyFLD_RT.inits
2. Second run ring.exe (from src/ring) on the newly-created output
   files:
      mpirun -np (# of cores) ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
3. Run enzo.exe (from src/enzo) with the main enzo parameter file:
      mpirun -np (# of cores) enzo.exe -d CosmologyFLD_RT.enzo

(replace mpirun to the mpi distribution installed on your particular machine)

== Comparing the statistics in DD0273 ==
running the included YT analysis script (findextrema.py and variance.py) with python in the 
same directory with the Enzo simulationfield value gives the following

1.5 with some modded 2.0 calc_rates.src values:

Density
min 5.3446543648750223e-30
max 6.9461703218095086e-26

== Variance ==
The variances were calculated from taking the difference of the corresponding cell between 
the 1.5 and 2.0 run, summed over the differences squared, divided by the number of cells, 
then took the square-rooted value at the end.

Density Variance     1.1659504614412593e-29
Gas_Energy Variance  9.4472590875724991e+10
Temperature Variance 3.9217566588040341e+02

-------------------------------------------
The variances of the different fields show that the simulation cells of 1.5 and 2.0 differ
from each other not just by machine noise. On average, values from cell to cell are of the 
same order of magnitude, which is reflected by the mean values being the same order of 
magnitude as the variance.  The differences can be attributed to a couple of changes from
1.5 to 2.0.  Namely the updated way gas cools and the slight modification to the star maker
routines.

Since Enzo 1.5+RT was not a public release, the comparisons between 2.0 and 1.5+RT are
strictly just for checking consistencies between the two codes to make sure they behave correctly.  
With the corrections, bug fixes, additions of new physics in 2.0, we believe we should trust the    
2.0 results more and use it as the new code base for future work.

== Visual Inspection ==
Included in the folder are other YT scripts that will generate 2D projections of different fields.
They may be used to generate a projection from inidvidual output or from all the outputs for a
movie rendering later.

to use the YT scripts to generate the fields first make a folder named "frames"
>mkdir frames
then run the YT script with the python installation you installed YT with
>python <script name>
for example
>python moviesDens.py

running script moviesDens.py give:
movieDensity_0273.png     
This should show filamentry structure of dense hydrogen, and where the filaments intersect
will show orange or red dots indicating the highest concentration of matter.  The voids in
between the filaments should occupy the most volume and be of the color blue and purple.

running script moviesEmis.py give:
movieEmissivity_0273.png  
This should show just a couple of dots on the screen, indicating where the star that is
contributing to the radiation feedback are located.

running script moviesGrey.py give:
movieGrey_Radiation_Energy_0273.png
This should show radiation energy centered around the same location of Emissivity projection.
The radiation will be the highest near the sources of Emissivity, and lower as radial distances
increases away from the source.  This snapshot should be before radiation energy evelops the
simulation volume, so one should expect a lot of purple region devoid of radiation energy.

running script moviesIon.py give:
movieIonizationFraction_0273.png
This should show ionized regions centered around the same location of Emissivity projection.
Due to the possibility of collisional ionization, one might see some ionization occur in region
besides where the radaition energy has propagated to.  However, most of the ionization should
still be caused by radiation energy, so expect the largest region of ionization correspond to
the distribution like in the projection of Grey_Radiation_Energy field.

running script moviesTemp.py give:
movieTemperature_0273.png
This should show roughly the same picture as the IonizationFraction.  It should also have 
some area of hot temperature but not hot enough to cause significant ionization.

running script DataSFR.py give:
StarFormationRate.txt
This file will have the 6 columns
# 1) years after big bang
# 2) total emissivity contributing to feedback (actually emissivity density) values in the box in units erg/s/cm^3 (in proper cm)
# 3) redshift
# 4) number of cells with feedback sources
# 5) total mass of all star particles
# 6) total number of stars
==>Note: not all stars contribute to Emissivity field or feedback, please see star_maker2.src, 
   CalcEmiss.C, used more to track ionization instead of star formation rate.
       
running YT_SFR.py give:
YTStarFormationRate.out
This file will have the 7 columns
# 1) Time (yrs)
# 2) Look-back time (yrs)
# 3) Redshift
# 4) Star formation rate in this bin per year (Msol/yr)
# 5) Star formation rate in this bin per year per Mpc**3 (Msol/yr/Mpc**3) (in proper Mpc)
# 6) Stars formed in this time bin (Msol)
# 7) Cumulative stars formed up to this time bin (Msol)
==>Note: This is the recommended way for users who want strictly just the star formation rate

= Conclusion =
Comparing the mean values of the fields, they are well within 1% of each other for Density 
and Temperature, ~7% of each other for Gas_Energy and so considering the many differences 
between the two versions, I'm surprised that the result is not much more different.  As a new 
user of Enzo, I would check that the value is not many of orders of magnitude off when running 
this particular set of parameters on a different machine.  And if it was ran on SDSC Triton 
where this test was conducted, it should give similar results to 2.0.  I would not look for
bitwise identicality since the 2.0 run was the beta release, so the bug fixes along the way or
small modifications will definitely change things a little bit.
