Shapiro & Giroux Cosmological Ionization Tests
[Isothermal, cosmological radiative ionization, static medium]


In this problem, we couple E and nHI together in an isothermal, 
hydrodynamically-static but cosmologically-expanding environment.  The
physical situation of interest is the expansion of an ionized hydrogen
(HII) region in a cosmologically-expanding uniform gas around a single
monochromatic ionizing source emitting 5e48 photons per second at the
ionization frequency of hydrogen (h\nu = 13.6 eV).  We enforce a fixed
gas temperature of T=1e4 K.  In such a problem, the radiation source
should rapidly ionize the surrounding hydrogen, and then should
develop a spherically-propagating ionization front (I-front) that 
propages quickly at first, slows, and approaches the Stromgren
radius, where ionization (HI -> HII) and recombinations (HII -> HI)
balance. However, due to the cosmological expansion, the front should
then begin to lag behind as cosmological expansion drives the
Stromgren radius outward faster than the I-front can propagate.  

We have 4 related tests. Here, q0 is the cosmological deceleration
parameter and z0 is the initial redshift:
 1. q0=0.5, z0=4: L~80 kpc, H0=0.5, \Omega_m=1, \Omega_L=0,
    \Omega_b=0.2. 
 2. q0=0.05, z0=4: L~60 kpc, H0=1, \Omega_m=0.1, \Omega_L=0,
    \Omega_b=0.1. 
 3. q0=0.5, z0=10: L~36 kpc, H0=0.5, \Omega_m=1, \Omega_L=0,
    \Omega_b=0.2. 
 4. q0=0.05, z0=10: L~27 kpc, H0=1, \Omega_m=0.1, \Omega_L=0,
    \Omega_b=0.1. 
Here L is the initial box size, H0 is the Hubble constant, \Omega_m is
the contribution of all non-relativistic matter to the gas energy
density at z=0 (in units of the value required to close the universe),
similarly \Omega_L and \Omega_b are the contributions of the
cosmological constant and the baryonic matter to the energy density,
respectively.  

We have the following problem parameters: 
- the initial radiation energy density is E=1e-35 erg cm^{-3},
- the initial ionization fraction (HII/H) is 0,
- the ionization source is located in the lower corner of the box (the
  (1,1,1) cell),
- we use reflecting boundary conditions at the x-, y- and z-left
  boundaries, and outflow conditions at the corresponding right
  boundaries,
- the initial density is dependent on q0, with \rho=1.175e-28 g cm^{-3}
  for q0=0.5, and \rho=2.35e-28 g cm^{-3} for q0=0.05,
- all simulations are run from the initial redshift z0 to z=1.  


Shapiro & Giroux provide an analytical solution for the expansion of
the I-front in relation to the Stromgren radius as a function of
redshift.  This analytical solution has been coded into the analysis
scripts sg_q5z4_makeplots.py, sg_q05z4_makeplots.py,
sg_q5z10_makeplots.py and sg_q05z10_makeplots.py, which compare the
computed solution with these analytical values.
