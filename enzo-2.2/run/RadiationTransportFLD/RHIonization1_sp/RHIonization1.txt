Iliev et al. Ionization Test 1
[Isothermal, radiative ionization in a static medium]


In this problem we couple E and nHI together in an isothermal,
hydrodynamically-static environment. The physical situation of
interest is the expansion of an ionized hydrogen (HII) region in a
uniform gas around a single monochromatic ionizing source emitting
5e48 photons per second at the ionization frequency of hydrogen (h\nu
= 13.6 eV).  We enforce a fixed gas temperature of T=1e4 K.  In such a
problem, the radiation source should rapidly ionize the surrounding
hydrogen, and then should develop a spherically-propagating ionization
front (I-front) that propages quickly at first, slows, and then
eventually stagnates at an equilibrium position referred to as the
Stromgren radius, where ionization (HI -> HII) and recombinations 
(HII -> HI) balance.  

We have the following problem parameters: 
- the domain size is L=6.6 kpc in each direction,
- the initial gas number density is nH = 1e-3 cm^{-3},
- the initial radiation energy density is E=1e-20 erg cm^{-3},
- the initial ionization fraction (HII/H) is 0.0012,
- the ionization source is located in the lower corner of the box (the
  (1,1,1) cell),
- we use reflecting boundary conditions at the x-, y- and z-left
  boundaries, and outflow conditions at the corresponding right
  boundaries.  
- the total simulation time is 500 Myr.

For this scenario, Iliev et al. provide an analytical solution for the
I-front position as a function of time.  This analytical solution has
been coded into the analysis script iliev1_makeplots.py, which
compares the computed solution with these analytical values.
