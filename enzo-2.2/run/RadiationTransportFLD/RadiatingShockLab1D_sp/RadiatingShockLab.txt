Radiating Shock Test (Lab Frame)


In this problem we couple E and e together in a test where we examine
the propagation of shock waves for which the radiation energy plays a
significant role in the shock structure and evolution.  Radiating
shock waves represent a broad class of phenomena figuring prominently 
in both astrophysical and terrestrial applications.  The particular
formulation of the problem we present is due to Lowrie and Edwards,
who considered the propagation of planar, steady shock waves in the
grey nonequilibrium diffusion limit.  Under the assumption of steady
flow, they transform the coupled gas and radiation energy equations
into a set of nonlinear ODEs in dimensionless gas and radiation
temperature variables, which may be integrated numerically to achieve
semi-analytic solutions. Nonetheless, their radiation diffusion model
corresponds identically to that implemented in Enzo in the grey LTE
limit, and the unique structure of the post-shock material temperature
profile for a given Mach number makes this problem an excellent
verification test for computer codes.

In this laboratory version of the problem, we run the Mach-2 test case
described by Lowrie & Edwards, using the following problem parameters:  
- the domain size is L=0.1 cm in length
- the uniform initial density is 1.0 g cm^{-3},
- the radiation constant is 137.20172 erg cm^{-3} eV^{-4} 
- the constant specific heat is 2.218056e12 erg g^{-1} eV^{-1}
- the uniform initial velocity is 1.9475e5 cm s^{-1}
- the material and radiation are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium
  at t=0 at a temperature of 121.6 eV,
- outflow and reflecting boundary conditions are imposed upon the left
  and right boundaries, respectively, resulting in a shock wave that
  forms near the right boundary and propagates to the left,
- the total evolution time is 1.73325 nanoseconds.


In the computed solutions, both the gas and radiation should have
dimensionless far-field temperatures of 1.0 in the pre-shock state.
Moreover, one should observe the following solution behaviors in the
gas temperature curve: the precursor region, in which the material is
preheated ahead of the shock front by the radiation wave which travels
ahead of the shock; the Zel'dovich spike, as shown by the overshoot in
temperature at the shock front, and the radiation relaxation region,
delineated by the decline in the material temperature to its eventual
far-field postshock value.
