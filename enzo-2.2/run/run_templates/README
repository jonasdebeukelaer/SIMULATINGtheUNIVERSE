This directory stores templates for running the test simulations on various 
machines.  After adding a template, you must add an entry to the machines 
dictionary in test_runner.py.  Each entry in the dictionary must be also be a 
dictionary that contains the entried 'script' and 'command'.  The script entry 
should be the name of the script file you have just added here.  The command 
entry gives the command required to run that script.  Locally, this would be 
something like bash.  On a supercomputer with a queueing system, this would 
likely be 'qsub'.
