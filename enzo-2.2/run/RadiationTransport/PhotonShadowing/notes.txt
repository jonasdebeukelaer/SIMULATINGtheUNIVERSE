PhotonShadowing
----------

This problem tests shadowing capabilities of the ray tracing module
with an optically-thick clump absorbing radiation from a source at the
opposite edge.  It has the same parameters (at lower resolution but
with AMR) as Test 3 in Iliev et al. (2006) MNRAS, 371, 1057.  The
ambient medium is optically-thin and the radiation should immediately
hit the clump and start ionizing and heating it.  The ionization front
should reach slightly past halfway in the clump at the end of the
simulation.  In this setup, there is a analytic solution and can be
found in Shapiro et al. (2004), MNRAS, 348, 753.


This test produces 15 outputs at intervals of 1 Myr.  The analysis
script (1) calculates the average temperature and ionized fraction of the
clump in each output, (2) gives line cuts through the clump center at
1,3,5,10,15 Myr, and (3) produces slices through the clump center at
the final time.
