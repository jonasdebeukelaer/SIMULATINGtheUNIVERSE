----------

This problem is the classical HII region expansion in an isothermal
sphere with a constant density core with a point source at the origin.
The source has a T=10^5 K blackbody spectrum with 1 energy group.  It
has the same parameters (at a lower base resolution, but with AMR) as
Test 6 in Iliev et al. (2009) MNRAS, 400, 1283.  The source should
heat and ionize a spherical region around it and drive a shock
outwards.  There is no analytical solution to this problem but has
been studied in great detail.

This test produces 25 outputs at intervals of 1 Myr.  The analysis
script (1) finds the ionization front radius for each output, (2)
creates radial profiles at a few times, (3) produces slices at the
origin in the final output, and (4) computes the deviation in the
photo-ionization rates from 1/r^2.
