This problem is the classical HII region expansion in a uniform static
(i.e. hydro off) medium with a mono-chromatic point source at the
origin.  It has the same parameters (at 4x lower resolution) as Test 1
in Iliev et al. (2006) MNRAS, 371, 1057.  The source should heat and
ionize a spherical region around it.  It should grow proportionally to
(1 - exp(-t/t_rec))^(1/3), where t_rec = 122 Myr is the recombination
time at 10,000 K.

This test produces 25 outputs at intervals of 10 Myr.  The analysis
script finds the ionization front radius for each output, produces
slices at the origin in the final output, and computes the deviation
in the photo-ionization rates from 1/r^2.  This test does not have
AMR.
