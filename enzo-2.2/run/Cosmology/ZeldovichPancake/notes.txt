ZeldovichPancake
----------

(John Wise, July 2010)

This test simulates a collapsing sinusoidal cosmological pertubation
in one-dimension, commonly known as a Zel'dovich pancake.  This
problem tests both the hydrodynamics and gravity solvers and the
implementation of cosmological expansion.  The system will form a
caustic in the center of the domain with a density and temperature
peak.  There should be a small dip in temperature at the center of the
broad peak.  In flat cosmology, there exists an analytical solution in
the linear phase of collapse and is given in Zel'dovich (1970).

This test runs to completion and creates 2 outputs -- the initial
(z=20) and final (z=0) states.  There is no refinement.  Enzo v1.5 and
v2.0 produce exactly the same results.
