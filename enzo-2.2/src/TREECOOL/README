TREECOOL.py

This script will re-create the TREECOOL file that is used within Gadget
Equilibrium cooling. I (Stephen Skory) adapted an IDL script written by
Pascal Paschos to Python. IDL is great, but it is very not free, and this
script will work anywhere Python works.

The usage is simple. Edit the top of the Python script to your liking and 
invoke 'python TREECOOL.py'. It will output a new file 'TREECOOL.mod' with
your new UV background.
