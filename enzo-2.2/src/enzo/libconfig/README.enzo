We have modified the source tree in a very minor way.  We have applied this
patch to scanner.l (modified version included):

89,90c89,90
< integer           [-+]?[0-9]+
< integer64         [-+]?[0-9]+L(L)?
---
> 
> integer64         [-+]?[0-9]+(L(L)?)?
165d164
< {integer}         { yylval->ival = atoi(yytext); return(TOK_INTEGER); }

This removed the integer as a potential parse-target, and forces everything to
64-bit integers.  As such we have not provided a purely-libconfig experience.
After this patch was applied, scanner.c was re-generated using lex.
