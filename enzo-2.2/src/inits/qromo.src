      subroutine qromo(func,a,b,ss,choose)

!     Romberg integration on an open interval. returns as ss
!     the integral of the function func from a to b. using
!     any specified integrating sunroutine "choose" and
!     Romberg's' method. normally "choose" will be an open
!     formula, not evaluating the function at the endpoints.
!     it is assumed that "choose" triples the number of steps
!     on each call, and that its error series contains only
!     even powers of the number of steps. the routines
!     "midpnt", "midinf", "midsql", "midsqu", are possible
!     choices for "choose".

      subroutine polint(xa,ya,n,x,y,dy)

!     this is a routine for polynomial interpolation or

!     the returned value y = p(x).

!     after each column in the tableau is completed, we
!     decided which correction , c or d, we want to add 
!     to our accumulating value of y, i.e. which path to
!     take through the tableau --- forking up or down.
!     we do this in such a way as to take the most 
!     "straight line" route through the tableau to its apex,
!     updating ns accordingly to keep track of where we are.
!     this route keeps the partial approximationa centered
!     (insofar as possible) on the target x. the last dy
!     added is thus the error indication.

      subroutine midinf(funk,aa,bb,s,n)


!     this subroutine is an exact replacement for "midpnt",
!     i.e. returns as "s" the n-th stage of refinement of the
!     integral of "func" from aa to bb, except that the function
!     is evaluated at evenly spaced points in 1/x rather than 
!     in x. this allows the upper limit bb to be as large and
!     positive as the computer allows, or the lower limit aa
!     to be as large and negative, but not both. aa and bb must
!     have the same sign.

      subroutine midpnt(func,a,b,s,n)


!     this routine computes the n-th stage of refinement of an

!     estimate of integral. subsequent calls with n = 2,3,... (in that
!     sequential order) will improve the accuracy of "s" by adding
!     (2/3)*3^{n-1} additional interior points. "s" should not be
!     modified between sequential calls.
