Enzo Documentation README

In this directory and below are the Enzo documentation. They are written
using the ReST [1] formatting, which is parsed into final formats using the
Sphinx formatting engine [2].

Here are some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx:

- ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text.
- Now that the documents are included in the Enzo mecurial repository,
  wherever you are (Plane, Train, Automobile), all the documents are there
  without needing access to the internet.
- Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most notably HTML
  and a PDF.

For more information about building the docs, please see (relative to this
