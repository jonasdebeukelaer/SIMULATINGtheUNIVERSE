Controlling Enzo data output
============================

How and when Enzo outputs data is described below.  There are five ways to
control when data is output, two output formats, and two pitfalls when
determining how to output data from your Enzo simulation.

Data Formats and Files
----------------------

There are two output formats for Enzo data. In both cases, each
data dump gets its own directory.

Each data dump writes several key files. NNNN denotes the dump
number (i.e. 0001) and basename is something like RedshiftOutput or
data or DD}.

All output files are also restart files. It's not necessarily wise
to write in 32 bit format if you're computing in 64, though, as
you'll lose all the extra precision when you restart. (These are
makefile flags.)

.. highlight:: none

basenameNNNN::

    The parameter file. This contains general simulation parameters,
    dump time, cycle, and all the parameters defined here. It's worth
    your time to be familiar with what's in this file.


basenameNNNN.hierarchy::

    The hierarchy file in text format. Contains a description of the hierarchy. One
    entry for each grid, including information like the Grid Size, the
    position in the volume, it's position in the hierarchy.


basenameNNNN.boundary::

    A description of the boundary (plain text.) Basically a meta
    description and filename for the next file


basenameNNNN.boundary.hdf5::

    Actually contains the boundary information.

basenameNNNN.harrays::

    The hierarchy of grids stored in HDF5 binary format.

Packed AMR
~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default output format. Each processor outputs all the grids it owns.
In addition to the parameter, hierarchy, and boundary files which may or may
not be described elsewhere, data is output in one basenameNNNN.taskmapCCCC}
file for each processor, which contains a map between grid number and HDF5
file, and one basenameNNNN.cpuCCCC for each processor NNNN and CCCC are the
dump number and cpu number, respectively.

basenameNNNN.cpuCCCC is an HDF5 file which contains an HDF5 group for each
grid. Each grid in turn contains a dataset for each of the fields in the
simulation.

::

    ~/DD0100>h5ls data0100.cpu0003 
    Grid00000002             Group
    Grid00000026             Group
    ~/DD0100>h5ls data0100.cpu0003/Grid00000002
    Density                  Dataset {16, 16, 32}
    z-velocity               Dataset {16, 16, 32}

Pathnames
---------

In previous versions of Enzo, the fully-qualified path to each file was output
in the ``.hierarchy`` file, which requires modifying the ``.hierarchy`` file
every time the data was moved.  This has changed to be only the *relative* path
to each data file, which largely eliminates the problem.  To restore the old
behavior, examine the parameters ``GlobalDir`` and ``LocalDir``.

Timing Methods
--------------

There are 6 ways to trigger output from Enzo.

Cycle Based Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    CycleSkipDataDump = N
    CycleLastDataDump = W
    DataDumpName = data

One can trigger output every N cycles starting with cycle W using
CycleSkipDataDump and CycleLastDataDump. Outputs are put in the
directory DD0000 (or DD0001, etc.) and the basename is determined
by DataDumpName.

CycleSkipDataDump <= 0 means cycle based output is skipped. The
default is 0.

Pitfall 2: CycleLastDataDump defaults to zero and is incremented by
CycleSkipDataDump every time output is done. If you change the
value of CycleSkipDataDump and neglect to change CycleLastDataDump,
Enzo will dump as long as CycleNumber >= CycleSkipDataDump +
CycleLastDataDump. (So if you change CycleSkipDataDump from 0 to 10
from a Redshift dump at n=70, you'll get an output every timestep
for 7 timesteps.)

Time Based Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    TimeLastDataDump = V
    dtDataDump = W

Exactly like Cycle based output, but triggered whenever time >=
TimeLastDataDump + dtDataDump. The same pitfall applies.

Redshift Based Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    CosmologyOutputRedshift[ 0 ] = 12
    CosmologyOutputRedshiftName[ 0 ] = Redshift12
    RedshiftDumpName             = RedshiftOutput

Outputs at the specified redshift. Any number of these can be
specified.

CosmologyOutputRedshift[ i ] is the only necessary parameter, and
is the ith redshift to output.

Any outputs with CosmologyOutputRedshiftName[ i ] specified has
that name used for the output, and no number is appended. (so if
CosmologyOutputRedshiftName[ 6 ] = BaconHat, the outputs will be
BaconHat, BaconHat.hierarchy, etc.)

If CosmologyOutputRedshiftName[ i ] is omitted, RedshiftDumpName is
used for the basename, and the output number is taken from the
array index. (So CosmologyOutputRedshift[19] = 2.34 and
RedshiftDumpName = MonkeyOnFire, at dump will be made at z=2.34
with files called MonkeyOnFire0019.hierarchy, etc.)

.. _force_output_now:

Force Output Now
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following two options are run time driven. These are especially
useful for very deep simulations that spend the majority of their
time on lower levels.  Note that unless you have the parameter
``FileDirectedOutput`` turned on, these will not be available.

To force an output as soon as the simulation finished the next step
on the finest resolution, make a file called outputNow:

::

    touch outputNow

This will remove the file as soon as the output has finished.

Sub Cycle Based Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the simulation to output every 10 subsycles (again at the
finest level of resolution) put the number of subcycles to skip in
a file called subcycleCount:

::

    echo 10 > subcycleCount

Time Based Interpolated Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even when you are running simulations with a long dtDataDump, sometimes you may
want to see or analyze the interim datadumps.  Using dtInterpolatedDataDump,
you can control Enzo to check if it should start outputting interpolated data
based on the time passed (dtInterpolatedDataDump < dtDataDump).

::

    dtDataDump = 1e-4
    dtInterpolatedDataDump = 1e-5

This is mostly for making movies or looking at the interim data where the
TopGrid dt is too long, and in principle, this output shouldn't be used for
restart.

Friendly Note on Data Output
----------------------------

Enzo is content to output enough data to fill up a hard drive --
for instance, your home directory. This should be noted before
output parameters are set, particularly the Sub Cycle outputs, as
Enzo has no prohibition against causing problems with quotas and
file system size.
