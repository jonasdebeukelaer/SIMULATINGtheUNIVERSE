Enzo Flow Chart, Source Browser
===============================

`Here's a cartoon of
Enzo. <http://lca.ucsd.edu/software/enzo/v1.5/flowchart/>`_ This was
written as a first look as the details of how enzo works.  Black
arrows indicate further flow charts. Grey boxes (usually) indicate
direct links to the source code.

No guarantees are made regarding the correctness of this flowchart --
it's meant to help get a basic understanding of the flow of Enzo
before extensive code modifications.  `Also see the Enzo Source
Browser. <http://lca.ucsd.edu/software/enzo/v1.0.1/source_browser/>`_
This is a second attempt at the same thing in a more dynamic way.  It
allows one to (in principle) see all the routines called from a
function, in order, and jump to the source showing the call. It also
allows you to see a reverse call stack of every routine that calls a
particular function.
